    <h2>About Edima Inwang</h2>
    <p>My name is Edima Inwang, a software developer currenly running an MSc programme with the Universit of Northampton
        I developed a passion for computers quite early in life but decided to pursue a career in User Interface Design.
        I worked with software developers and identified their challenge with design, hence the reason I decided 
        to start a career in development.
